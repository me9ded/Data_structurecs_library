# Overview
This repository contains a data structure library that allows you to use linked lists, hash tables, and trees in C.

# How to use it
For now, you can simply download the files into your project directory and include the header files in your C source files:

```C
#include "linked_list.h"
```

# Example
You will then be able to use the predefined functions. (The example below uses the hash table, but the same logic applies to the other data structures.)
```C
#include "hash_table.h"

int main(){
    int result;
    Hash_Table *arr = create_hash_table();
    result = search(0);
}
```
